When I was looking up the route I spotted a thing called &quot;Spuds&quot;; it turned out to be a tiny hamlet consisting of a few scattered houses and a shop selling farm produce. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> We thought we\'d gone way past it so we asked in a gas station about 10 miles away. The woman behind the counter had never heard of it but a customer said &quot;You want Spuds?&quot; as if we must be mad. &quot;You go down here a ways - but there ain\'t nothin\' there \'cept a shop sellin\' spuds&quot;. <br /> <br /> Brilliant!<\/p>",
